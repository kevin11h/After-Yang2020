Who's still fighting our War for Ｆｒｅｅｄｏｍ　Ｄｉｖｉｄｅｎｄ　and anti-poverty to save the normal people? I'd like to keep in contacts (War's not over) - Can everyone send me an e-mail or their e-mail address if interested in teaming up Ally? Thank you! Let's not lose or abort all our hard work and give up  kevhung11@gmail.com 1 Corinthians 15:12-19 New International Version (NIV) The Resurrection of the Dead 12 But if it is preached that Christ has been raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? 13 If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised. 14 And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith. 15 More than that, we are then found to be false witnesses about God, for we have testified about God that he raised Christ from the dead. But he did not raise him if in fact the dead are not raised. 16 For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised either. 17 And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins. 18 Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost. 19 If only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are of all people most to be pitied.
